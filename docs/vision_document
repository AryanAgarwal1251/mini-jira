## 📌 Project Overview

**Mini Jira** is a simplified project management and issue-tracking web application inspired by Jira. It is designed specifically for **student projects, small teams, and academic environments** where full-scale enterprise tools are unnecessary or overly complex.

The system enables users to:
- Create and manage projects  
- Create, assign, and track tasks (issues)  
- Monitor progress using clear task statuses  
- Collaborate efficiently through a clean and minimal interface

## ❓ Problem Statement

Existing project management tools (e.g., Jira) are often:

- Overly complex for small teams and academic projects  
- Heavy in configuration with a steep learning curve  
- Paid or restrictive in advanced features  

### ✅ Solution: Mini Jira

Mini Jira addresses these problems by:

- Providing **only essential project-tracking features**  
- Reducing **cognitive load and UI complexity**  
- Offering a **lightweight, easy-to-understand workflow** suitable for students and small development teams

## 🎯 Target Users (Personas)

### 1. Student Developer
- Works on academic or personal software projects  
- Needs basic task tracking and deadlines  
- Prefers simplicity over enterprise-grade features  

### 2. Small Team / Startup Developer
- Works in small teams (2–5 members)  
- Needs task assignment and progress visibility  
- Does not want the overhead of full Jira  

### 3. Instructor / Evaluator
- Reviews student project workflows  
- Requires visibility into task planning and execution  
- Uses the tool for assessment and demonstrations  

---

## 🌟 Vision Statement

> To build a lightweight, intuitive, and developer-friendly project management tool that helps small teams and students plan, track, and complete software projects efficiently without unnecessary complexity.

## 🚀 Key Features & Goals

### Core Features
- User authentication (login / register)  
- Project creation and management  
- Issue / task creation with:
  - Title and description  
  - Priority (Low / Medium / High)  
  - Status (To Do / In Progress / Done)  
- Task assignment to users  
- Basic dashboard view of project progress  

### Functional Goals
- Simple and intuitive UI  
- Minimal learning curve  
- Fast task creation and updates  
- Clear visibility of project status  

### Stretch Goals (Future Scope)
- Kanban-style board

## 📊 Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful if:

- Users can create and manage projects without external guidance  
- Tasks move smoothly through defined statuses  
- The system supports a complete project lifecycle  
- Performance remains responsive with multiple projects and users  
- The codebase follows clean architecture and is easy to extend  

---

## ⚙️ Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with software projects  
- Internet connectivity is available  
- The application is used primarily for small-scale projects  

### Constraints
- Limited development time (academic semester)  
- Single-repository deployment  
- Scope intentionally limited (not a full Jira replacement)  
- Focus on core functionality over UI polish  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript *(or React)*  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express *(or Django / Flask)*  
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL  
- **Authentication:** JWT or session-based authentication  

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Mini Jira aims to strike a balance between **usability and functionality**, providing just enough features to manage projects effectively while remaining accessible to students and small teams.

It serves both as:
- A **practical project management tool**, and  
- A **learning project** demonstrating real-world software engineering concepts such as authentication, REST APIs, and clean architecture.
