# MoSCoW Prioritization – Mini Jira

## Introduction
MoSCoW prioritization is used to clearly define the scope of the Mini Jira project by categorizing requirements into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have. This ensures that core functionality is delivered first while keeping the project feasible within academic time and resource constraints.
